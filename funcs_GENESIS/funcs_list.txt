New GENESIS Functions
---------------------

GENESIS functions for object manipulation:*
stochastify:		Function to search through element trees and
			automatically convert deterministic channels
			to stochastic channels (uses libraries)

volumeconnect_general:	Generalized version of volumeconnect command to work
			with either deterministic or stochastic synapses

markov_synapse:		Specialized function to automatically flip
			deterministic synapses to stochastic synapses
			(can pass to volumeconnect_general).

spike_synapse:		Creates a deterministic synaptic connection. Can pass
			to volumeconnect_general to cause it to behave as
			the standard volumeconnect command.

gapconnect_general: 	Similar to volumeconnect_general, except for forming
			gap junction connections.
