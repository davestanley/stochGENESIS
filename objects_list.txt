GENvgpores: 	Voltage-gated ion channels with stochastic gating; supports
		variable numbers of gates ( 0-4 activating gates and 0-1 inactivating
		gates); HH-based rate constants

GENgap:		4-state gap junction with stochastic gating

GENsynpores:	Generalized transmitter-gated synapses with stochastic gating

GENtabchan:	Same as GENvgpores, but rate constants are based on tables

GEN_Gprotein:	Stochastic simulations of G-protein concentrations

*Note*: I am using Chow and White's algorithm to govern the evolution of the
markov chain. See Mino et al 2002 - Comparison of algorithms for
the simulation of action potentials with stochastic sodium channels, Annals
of Biomedical Engineering.
